Description
===========
A bash script to run after installing Chrubuntu on an Acer C710 chromebook. The script does a few things:

1) [Optional] Creates a new admin user with the name of your choosing. By default, chrubuntu starts with only 1 user, named "user."

2) Creates a script on the desktop for rebooting into ChromeOS. 

3) Installs some web development tools (a lamp server, git, sublime text 2, sass/compass)

4) Fixes some bugs in the default installation (enables some shortcut buttons, fixes the trackpad, fixes virtual box, fixes the bug where closing the lid leads to high CPU usage)

Usage
=====
After installing Chrubuntu on your Acer C710 chromebook, simply run this script with no arguments. Answer the command prompts and enjoy your Chrubuntu experience!
